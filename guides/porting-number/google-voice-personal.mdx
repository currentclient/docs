If you would like to port an existing phone number from Google Voice (Personal) to CurrentClient, follow these steps:

1. Unlock your Google Voice (Personal) phone number by logging in to Google Voice and going to **Settings -> Account -> Unlock**. Note that you may be charged a small fee by Google to do so.
2. Go to the [Port a number](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-number) page and choose Port Type: Calls & Texts.
3. Fill out the information on the page.
4. For the Account Number, enter the phone number you plan to port.
5. To get the Transfer/Port-away PIN, log in to Google Voice and go to **Settings -> Voicemail**. Turn on "Call to listen" and set a PIN if one hasn't already been set.
6. For the Billing Statement, take a screenshot of the Google Voice Settings page and make sure that the phone number is shown on it.
