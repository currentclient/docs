## What is SMS hosting?

SMS hosting lets you keep your existing phone provider for calls while using CurrentClient for all your texting needs. Your phone service stays exactly the same - you just get a powerful texting upgrade.

Here's how it works:

- You'll continue making and receiving calls through your current phone provider
- All texts will be sent and received through the CurrentClient app
- Your clients see the same phone number for both calls and texts
- Your phone number stays with your current provider - they just delegate texting to us

## When is SMS hosting a good idea?

SMS hosting is a great option in these scenarios:

**You have a landline that can't text**  
Your office has used the same landline number for years. Clients know it by heart, but you can't text them back when they message you. SMS hosting adds texting to that trusted number - complete with message archiving and automatic CRM sync. No need to get a second number or confuse clients.

**Your phone can't archive texts**  
You phone is working fine, but you can't get texting setup in a compliant way. Great option here to just add texting to your existing number and get texts archived and synced to your CRM.

**Your phone service is bundled with internet or other services**  
You're getting a great deal on internet, phone, and other services bundled together. Canceling just the phone portion would mess up your pricing or contract. SMS hosting lets you keep that bundle intact while upgrading your texting capabilities.

**You need specialized calling features we don't offer yet**  
Perhaps you need international calling to specific countries or specialized call center features. Keep using your current provider for those unique calling needs while we handle your text messaging.

## Can my phone be set up this way?
