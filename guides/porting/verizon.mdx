<Tip>
  Have your most recent Verizon billing statement ready - you'll need information
  from it.
</Tip>

## What you'll need

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Account Number" icon="receipt">
    10-22 digits (top right corner of billing statement)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Number Transfer PIN" icon="key">
    6 digits (generate from Verizon app). Good for 7 days.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Info" icon="user-check">
    Name and address (top left corner of billing statement)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step-by-step process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Disable Number Lock">
    - Go to the Verizon website -> Account -> Account Settings -> Security Settings -> Number Lock -> Off.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Account Number">
    - Look at the top right corner of your billing statement.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Number Transfer PIN">
    - Go to the My Verizon app -> Me -> Profile & settings -> Security -> Number Transfer PIN -> Generate PIN.
    - This PIN will be valid for 7 days. You will need to submit the port request to us as soon as possible so that the PIN is still valid.
    - This PIN should work for all phone numbers you port from this Verizon account. Business accounts, however, require a different PIN for each phone number.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Account Info">
    - Look at the top left corner of your billing statement to get the account name (either a person's name or a business name) and address.
    - Make sure you provide this information to us EXACTLY as it appears in order to prevent rejections by Verizon.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Authorized Representative Info">
    - Find out who is authorized to port out the phone number, and get their full name and email address. If the account name is a person's name, use that. If it's a business name, find out who is authorized to port out phone numbers for the account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Port In Request">
    - Once you have gathered all of this information, [submit your port in request](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-in/new) and we'll get working on it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Things to keep in mind

- Be sure to keep your Verizon account active until the entire porting process is complete.
- If your number is associated with an iPhone, we recommend turning off iMessage and FaceTime after the port completes in order to ensure that messages sent to you from other iPhones are properly routed to you:
  - Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive -> Uncheck your number under "You can be reached by iMessage at".
  - Settings -> FaceTime -> Uncheck your number under "You can be reached by FaceTime at".
  - If you continue to have issues, try [deregistering iMessage](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/).
