<Tip>
  Have your most recent Zoom billing statement ready - you'll need information
  from it.
</Tip>

## What you'll need

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Account Number" icon="receipt">
    6-10 digits (top left corner of billing statement)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Port Out PIN" icon="key">
    6 digits (generate from Zoom web portal)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Info" icon="user-check">
    Name and address (get from Zoom web portal)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step-by-step process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Account Number">
    - Look at the top left corner of your billing statement.
    - This can also be found in the Zoom web portal -> Account Management -> Account Profile -> Account Number. Note the Account Name as well while on this page -- it will be needed too.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Port Out PIN">
    - Without the Number Management section: Phone System Management -> Company Info -> Account Settings -> Security -> Port-out Verification -> Change.
    - With the Number Management section: Number Management -> Phone Numbers -> Related Features -> Port-out Verification -> Change.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Account Info">
    - Go to the Zoom web portal -> Account Management -> Account Profile -> Account Name to get the account name (either a person's name or a business name).
    - Go to the Zoom web portal -> Account Management -> Billing -> Billing Information -> Address -> grab the first address listed on the page.
    - Make sure you provide this information to us EXACTLY as it appears in order to prevent rejections by Zoom.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Authorized Representative Info">
    - Find out who is authorized to port out the phone number, and get their full name and email address. Go to the Zoom web portal -> User Management -> Users -> search for the Owner or Admin role -> take note of the first name, last name, and email address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Port In Request">
    - Once you have gathered all of this information, [submit your port in request](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-in/new) and we'll get working on it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Things to keep in mind

- Be sure to keep your Zoom account active until the entire porting process is complete.
- If the number is on a secondary or sub-account, use that account's details rather than the main or master account.
