# Great news, your port is complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your phone number has been successfully ported to CurrentClient. You might be wondering what to do next, so let's walk through the setup steps to get everything dialed in.

## Setup checklist

Here's what you'll want to do to get your newly ported number fully configured:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your inbox">
    First, log in and make sure you can see the inbox for your newly ported number.

    Head to your [phone numbers settings](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/phone-numbers) to confirm it's showing up correctly.

    <Tip>
      New to the inbox? Check out our [inbox overview guide](/guides/inbox/overview) to learn all about how it works.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

<Step title="Customize your inbox">
  Give your inbox a fun emoji and name - this is especially important when you
  have multiple numbers in an account. It helps you quickly identify which inbox
  you're working in.
</Step>

<Step title="Set inbox permissions">
  Decide who can view and use this inbox. By default, all team members now have
  permission for this number, so if you need to lock it down more, this is the
  time to do it.
</Step>

  <Step title="Configure your call settings">
    Should calls just ring to you? Or should they route through team members with an IVR? Keep it simple to start - you can modify this over time.

    In the inbox page, review the call settings and make sure your number is set up with the call routing you want and at least a voicemail greeting.

    <Tip>

    </Tip>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup check

Now that everything's configured, let's make sure it all works:

**Try inbound call** - Have someone call your number to make sure calls are routing correctly

**Try outbound call** - Try to call someone from your number

**Try inbound text** - Text your new number and make sure you are seeing it show up in CurrentClient

**Try outbound text** - Send a text to a family or friends from your number

<Note>
  Outbound messages may take a day or two before they go through on all
  carriers. Inbound messages work immediately, but if outbound texts aren't
  working right away, give it 24-48 hours.
</Note>
