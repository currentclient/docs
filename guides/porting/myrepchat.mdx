# Port from MyRepChat

<Warning>
  Before you start: Are you using MyRepChat for both calls and texts, or just
  texts?
</Warning>

## Do you use MyRepChat for calls?

This is important - your porting process depends on how you use MyRepChat:

**If you use MyRepChat for calls and texts:**

- Follow the instructions on this page

**If you only use MyRepChat for texts:**

- Your number is actually managed by your voice provider (like RingCentral or Zoom)
- You'll need to port from that provider instead
- Make sure to tell us the correct voice provider when submitting your port request

<Note>
  For SMS-only MyRepChat users: Even though you text through MyRepChat, your
  number lives with your calling provider. Port from them (RingCentral, Zoom,
  etc.) and let us know that's your provider.
</Note>

## What you'll need

If you're porting from MyRepChat (calls + texts), here's what you need:

  <Card title="Account Number" icon="receipt">
    7-digit number (call MyRepChat support to get this)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transfer PIN" icon="key">
    4-digit PIN (request from MyRepChat support)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing Proof" icon="file-invoice">
    Screenshot of your MyRepChat dashboard
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting your information

Follow these steps to gather everything you need:

1. **Contact MyRepChat support** and request:

   - Account number (7 digits, no dashes)
   - Transfer PIN (4 digits)

2. **Take a screenshot of your MyRepChat dashboard** that shows:
   - Your phone number (typically in the top right)
   - Your name
   - The MyRepChat interface

<Note>
  Don't worry if your screenshot doesn't show an address - that's normal for
  MyRepChat. You can use your A2P registration address when submitting the port.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I only use MyRepChat for texting, not calls">
    If you use another service for calls (like RingCentral or Zoom), you'll need to port from that provider instead. Your phone number lives with your calling service, not MyRepChat. Make sure to select the correct provider when submitting your port request.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't find my account number or PIN">
  MyRepChat doesn't include these on billing statements. You must contact their
  support team directly to get this information. They'll provide both your
  account number (7 digits) and PIN (4 digits).
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if MyRepChat uses Twilio instead of Bandwidth?">
    Some MyRepChat accounts may use Twilio as the carrier. If that's your case, its actually easier to do. Please still submit a port request form, but you can just put 0000 as the pin number and you don't need to ask MyRepChat for that.
