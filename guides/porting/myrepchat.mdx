# Port from MyRepChat

<Tip>
  You'll need to contact MyRepChat support to get your account number and PIN -
  they don't appear on your billing statement.
</Tip>

## What you'll need

MyRepChat uses Bandwidth as their carrier. Here's what you need to gather:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Account Number" icon="receipt">
    7-digit number (call MyRepChat support to get this)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transfer PIN" icon="key">
    4-digit PIN (call MyRepChat support to get this)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing Statement" icon="file-invoice">
    PDF or screenshot showing your name and number
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting your account details

MyRepChat requires you to contact them directly to get your porting information:

1. **Call or email MyRepChat support** and request your:

   - Account number (7 digits, no dashes)
   - Transfer PIN (4 digits)

2. **Get your billing statement**:
   - Download a PDF invoice from MyRepChat, OR
   - Take a screenshot of your billing screen that shows:
     - Your phone number (top right corner)
     - Your name
     - MyRepChat/Bandwidth branding

<Note>
  MyRepChat billing statements typically don't include an address. That's okay -
  you can use your A2P registration address for the port request.
</Note>

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can't find my account number or PIN">
    MyRepChat doesn't include these on billing statements. You must contact their support team to get this information. They'll provide both your account number (7 digits) and PIN (4 digits).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="My billing statement doesn't show an address">
  That's normal for MyRepChat invoices. Use the address from your A2P
  registration when submitting your port request. This has worked successfully
  for other MyRepChat ports.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if MyRepChat uses Twilio instead of Bandwidth?">
    Some MyRepChat accounts may use Twilio as the carrier. If that's your case, reach out to our support team - the porting process is slightly different for Twilio-based numbers.
