<Tip>
  Have your most recent Dialpad billing statement ready - you'll need information
  from it.
</Tip>

## What you'll need

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Account Number" icon="receipt">
    16 digits (top of billing statement under Company ID)
  </Card>
  <Card title="PIN" icon="key">
    4 digits (generate from Dialpad website)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Info" icon="user-check">
    Name and address (top of billing statement)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step-by-step process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Account Number">
    - Look at the top of your billing statement for Company ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get PIN">
    - Go to the [Dialpad porting page](https://dialpad.com/portout) -> enter the number(s) you'd like to port -> Get Pin number.
    - This PIN should work for all phone numbers you choose. If you decide to port more numbers later, you'll get another PIN for those.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Account Info">
    - Look at the top of your billing statement to get the account name (either a person's name or a business name) and address.
    - Make sure you provide this information to us EXACTLY as it appears in order to prevent rejections by Dialpad.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Authorized Representative Info">
    - Find out who is authorized to port out the phone number, and get their full name and email address. If the account name is a person's name, use that. If it's a business name, find out who is authorized to port out phone numbers for the account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Port In Request">
    - Once you have gathered all of this information, [submit your port in request](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-in) and we'll get working on it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Things to keep in mind

- Be sure to keep your Dialpad account active until the entire porting process is complete.
