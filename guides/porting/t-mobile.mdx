<Tip>
  Have your most recent T-Mobile billing statement ready - you'll need information
  from it.
</Tip>

## What you'll need

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Account Number" icon="receipt">
    9 digits for consumer plans, business plans vary (top right corner of billing statement)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transfer/Port Out PIN" icon="key">
    6 digits (generate from T-Life app). Good for 5-7 days.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Info" icon="user-check">
    Name and address (last page of billing statement)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step-by-step process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Disable Port Out Protection">
    - Go to the T-Life app -> Manage -> My account -> See Plans -> Manage add-ons -> Port Out Protection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Account Number">
    - Look at the top right corner of your billing statement.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Transfer/Port Out PIN">
    - While on the T-Mobile network, with Wi-Fi turned off, go to the T-Life app -> Manage -> gear icon -> Permsisions & controls -> Transfer PIN.
    - This PIN will be valid for 5-7 days. You will need to submit the port request to us as soon as possible so that the PIN is still valid.
    - If you are porting more than one phone number, you may need to get a PIN for each number.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Account Info">
    - Look at the last page of your billing statement to get the account name (either a person's name or a business name) and address.
    - Make sure you provide this information to us EXACTLY as it appears in order to prevent rejections by T-Mobile.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Authorized Representative Info">
    - Find out who is authorized to port out the phone number, and get their full name and email address. If the account name is a person's name, use that. If it's a business name, find out who is authorized to port out phone numbers for the account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Port In Request">
    - Once you have gathered all of this information, [submit your port in request](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-in/new) and we'll get working on it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Things to keep in mind

- Be sure to keep your T-Mobile account active until the entire porting process is complete.
- If your number is associated with an iPhone, we recommend turning off iMessage and FaceTime after the port completes in order to ensure that messages sent to you from other iPhones are properly routed to you:
  - Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive -> Uncheck your number under "You can be reached by iMessage at".
  - Settings -> FaceTime -> Uncheck your number under "You can be reached by FaceTime at".
  - If you continue to have issues, try [deregistering iMessage](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/).
