<Tip>
  Have your most recent RingCentral billing statement ready - you'll need information
  from it.
</Tip>

## What you'll need

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Account Number" icon="receipt">
    10 digits (top left corner of billing statement). This is the main phone number for your account.
  </Card>
  <Card title="PIN" icon="key">
    <strong>0000</strong> (RingCentral does not provide personalized PINs)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Account Info" icon="user-check">
    Name and address (get from RingCentral website)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step-by-step process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Account Number">
    - Look at the top left corner of your billing statement. This should be the main phone number for your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide PIN">
    - RingCentral does not require a PIN. Simply provide <strong>0000</strong> as the PIN.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Account Info">
    - Go to the RingCentral website -> Phone System -> Company Info to get the account name (this has to be the business name) and address. If this information is blank, you'll need to update it with your company name.
    - Make sure you provide this information to us EXACTLY as it appears in order to prevent rejections by RingCentral.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Authorized Representative Info">
    - Find out who is authorized to port out the phone number, and get their full name and email address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit Port In Request">
    - Once you have gathered all of this information, [submit your port in request](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-in) and we'll get working on it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Things to keep in mind

- Be sure to keep your RingCentral account active until the entire porting process is complete.
