# How do I port my number?

Want to keep using your existing phone number? No problem! We've put a lot of work into our porting process to make it as smooth as possible and have it dialed in.

## How porting works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather information from your current carrier">
    Each carrier requires different information - we'll show you exactly what to find and where to find it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit your port request">
    Fill out the [port request form](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-in) in the CurrentClient app with your carrier information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="We handle the nitty gritty details">
    We submit your request to the carriers and work with them to get it approved. If there are any issues, we'll loop you in.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Port gets approved and scheduled">
    Once approved, the port gets scheduled 7 days in the future, typically very early AM (1-2 AM MST) so it's ready when you wake up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cancel old service">
    Once the port fully completes, you can cancel your old service. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Timeline:** Assuming you have provided us with all of the correct information, most ports take about 7 days to complete from the time you submit the request. Note that some carriers take an additional 1-3 days to transfer over outbound texting capabilities.
</Callout>

## Two types of ports

We offer two port options to fit your needs:

- **Full port (calling and texting):** Port both calling and texting to CurrentClient. This is our most popular option - you'll handle everything in one app and can cancel your old provider.

- **Text-only port (SMS hosting):** Keep your current phone service for calling while using CurrentClient for texts. Great if you're happy with your voice service but want better texting capabilities.
