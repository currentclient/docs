# What is this?

Long story short, phone carriers want to know that you are a legitimate business and not going to be sending spam and low quality messages. Which, of course, is the case. But some hooligans out in the world do dumb things and this is why we can't have nice things.

The registration process is pretty simple and will take you about 10 minutes. We do much of the hard work for you, but we do need a few things from you.

<Tip>Note: The $50 onboarding fee is part of covering the fees we pay to the phone carriers on your behalf.</Tip>


## What you'll need

Before we dive in, make sure you have these details handy:

- Your firm's legal business name
- Business address and contact information
- Tax identification number (EIN)
- Privacy policy


## Fill out the form

Once you have those things ready to go, head over to the registration page in the app and fill out the simple form to provide that information to us.

## How does this help me?

<Note>
**What is A2P 10DLC?** It's a messaging system that helps carriers identify legitimate business texts from spam. By registering your firm, we handle all the technical setup so your messages get the best possible delivery rates.
</Note>

When you register your firm, we automatically set up A2P (Application-to-Person) 10DLC registration for your business messaging. Here's what this means for you:

- **Higher delivery rates** - Your business text messages reach clients more reliably
- **Improved sender reputation** - Carriers recognize your messages as legitimate business communications
- **Better message speeds** - Send messages faster with higher throughput limits
- **Reduced filtering** - Less chance of your messages being marked as spam or blocked
- **Industry compliance** - Meet carrier requirements for business messaging
