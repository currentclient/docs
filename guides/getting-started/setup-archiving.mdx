You've probably heard about archiving requirements and might be wondering what exactly you need to do. Don't worry - it's more straightforward than it sounds.

## What's this about?

Regulations like SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rules 4511 and 3110 require you to retain records of your business communications. This includes text messages - not just email.

The good news? You likely already have an archiver set up for your email. All you need to do is connect that same archiver to CurrentClient, and we'll automatically send your texts there too.

## Wait, is CurrentClient an archiver?

Good question. We do retain your records and store them securely. However, we don't provide the supervision and review tools that compliance programs require - things like flagging keywords, managing review workflows, and generating audit reports.

Since you already need those capabilities for your email, we've found it's much easier to feed your text message data into your existing archiver. That way, all your communications live in one system, making supervision and audits simpler for everyone.
