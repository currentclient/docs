## Choose your plan
During onboarding it will ask you to pick a plan. We have 2 options, Engage and Core. You'll need to pick a plan that fits your needs. Here's how to think about it...

  <Card title="Core Plan" icon="phone" color={iconActionColor}>
    Perfect if you want a full-featured phone system (VoIP) and will cancel your existing phone provider.

<Tip>Note: It's easy to change your plan later too, so don't worry about it too much.</Tip>

## What do you recommend I do?

### Are you a solo advisor?

Start simple! The Engage plan is a great option. You'll get:

- Dedicated business number for all client communications
- Archiving feed
- CRM integration
- Industry best inbox for managing 1:1 and group messages
- and more things...

<Tip>Do you also want calling? You can add call forwarding add on which will is a very simple and affordable way to make calls and receive calls using your dedicated business number.</Tip>


### Do you have a team?

The Core plan will likely work much better for you since it includes:

- Everything in Engage...
- Allows all users to make and receive calls with the same number
- Advanced call routing and management, like transfers and conferencing

## Pick your number

During onboarding, you'll be asked to choose a phone number. This step can be a little confusing, but you likely fall under one of these two categories...


<Accordion title="I want a new number.">

Great! You can just pick a new number with us during signup. Find one in your local area code - this helps clients feel more comfortable knowing you're local.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="I want to keep my existing number.">
We can do that! Just pick any temporary number for now during onboarding though. We'll walk you through the porting process in a later step, and you can switch to your existing number then.
</Accordion>

## You're all set!

Once you complete the trial signup and initial setup, you're ready for the next step. Let's get the apps installed so you can start using CurrentClient on all your devices.
