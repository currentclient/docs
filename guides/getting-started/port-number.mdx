# Port your number (optional)

Want to keep using your existing phone number with CurrentClient? No problem! Porting your number means your clients won't even notice the switch - they'll just call the same number they always have.

## Before you start

Number porting is completely optional, but here's why you might want to do it:

- **No client confusion** - Keep the same number your clients know and trust
- **Maintain your brand** - Continue using the number on your business cards and marketing
- **Seamless transition** - No need to notify clients about a new number

## What you'll need

To port your number, gather these items:

- Your current phone bill or account statement
- Account number with your current provider
- PIN or password for your current account
- Authorized contact information (must match your current account)

<Note>
**Important:** Don't cancel your current service until the port is complete! We'll handle the transfer process and your old service will automatically end when the port finishes.
</Note>

## The porting process

## Common porting scenarios

### From Google Voice
If you're moving from Google Voice, we have [detailed guides](/guides/porting-number/google-voice) to walk you through the process for both personal and business accounts.

### From traditional carriers
Most traditional phone carriers (Verizon, AT&T, etc.) work smoothly with our porting process. The main requirement is having your account information ready.

### From VoIP services
Many VoIP providers support number porting, though the process can vary. We'll work with you to ensure a smooth transition.

## During the port

While your number is being ported:

- **Keep your old service active** - Don't cancel until the port is complete
- **You can still use CurrentClient** - We'll provide a temporary number if needed
- **Stay in touch** - We'll update you on the progress every step of the way

## Troubleshooting

**Port taking longer than expected?** Sometimes carriers need additional verification. We'll reach out if we need any extra information from you.

**Need to cancel a port?** You can cancel anytime before it's approved, though we'd be happy to help resolve any issues first.
