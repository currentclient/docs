# How do I port my number?

Want to keep using your existing phone number? No problem! We've put a lot of work into our porting process to make it as smooth as possible and have it dialed in. Here's what you can expect.

## How porting works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather information from your current carrier">
    Each carrier requires different information - we'll show you exactly what to find and where to find it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Submit your port request">
    Fill out the [port request form](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/port-number) in the CurrentClient app with your carrier information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="We handle the nitty gritty details">
    We submit your request to the carriers and work with them to get it approved. If there are any issues, we'll loop you in.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Port gets approved and scheduled">
    Once approved, the port gets scheduled 7-10 days in the future, typically very early AM (1-2 AM) so it's ready when you wake up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cancel old service">
    Once the port is approved and scheduled, you can cancel your old service. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Timeline:** Most ports are approved within 3-5 business days and scheduled 7-10 days out from approval.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there any downtime during the port?">
    You can use your number normally while we wait for the scheduled port date. The actual cutover happens quickly and in most cases you'll notice no downtime.
    
    In rare cases, we may need to work with the phone carriers to resolve issues, but we'll jump on this right away and keep you informed throughout the process.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I port multiple numbers at once?">
    Yes! If you have multiple numbers to port, just reach out to us and we can batch them together to make the process easier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to do anything to get the port approved?">
    Just gather the information from your existing carrier and submit the port request in the app. We handle all the technical coordination with the carriers after that.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my port gets rejected?">
    No worries - this is rare, but if it happens, we'll work with you to identify what information needs to be corrected and resubmit quickly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if my carrier is not listed here?">
    All good! We can port from most carriers. Just fill out the port request form the best you can, most carriers have the same information.
