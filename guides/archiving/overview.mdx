If you're in financial services, you're likely required to archive your business communications. CurrentClient makes this easy by integrating with the most popular compliance archivers, so your texts are automatically captured and preserved.

## Why you need to archive

Financial regulators require firms to retain records of all business-related communications. This includes text messages, calls, and other electronic correspondence, regardless of whether they're sent through company systems or personal devices.

<Note>
  **SEC Rule 17a-4** is the primary regulation governing electronic recordkeeping for broker-dealers. It requires firms to preserve business communications for at least three years and make them accessible within 24 hours of a regulatory request.
</Note>

### Key regulations

**SEC Rule 17a-4** requires broker-dealers to:
- Preserve electronic communications (emails, texts, instant messages) for 3+ years
- Store records in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format (or use an audit-trail system)
- Produce records promptly upon regulatory request

**FINRA Rule 4511** requires member firms to:
- Make and preserve books and records per FINRA and SEC rules
- Retain records covering emails, texts, instant messages, and social media
- Comply regardless of whether communications are sent via firm or personal devices

**FINRA Rule 3110** requires firms to:
- Establish supervisory systems for electronic communications
- Review written and electronic communications as part of compliance procedures

Regulators actively enforce these requirements. Off-channel communications sent through personal devices or unauthorized apps like WhatsApp are a particular focus. Failing to archive business communications can result in significant penalties, including fines and suspension.
