Connect CurrentClient to your email archiver to automatically capture and archive all your text messages and calls for compliance purposes.

This is a generic option for archivers that aren't explicitly listed. You can use any email-based archiver that provides a journal destination email address.

To set up this integration, you'll need to provide the email journal address that your archiver set up for you.

*More details coming soon.*
