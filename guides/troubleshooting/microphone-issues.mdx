If CurrentClient can't access your microphone, don't worry—most issues are quick to resolve. Here's how to get things working again.

## Quick fixes

1. **Restart the app or refresh the page** — This resolves most temporary glitches
2. **Check your mic is connected** — Ensure it's plugged in, turned on, and not muted

<Tip>
  Restarting your computer often fixes microphone issues on both Windows and
  macOS.
</Tip>

## macOS settings

Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone** and enable CurrentClient. Restart the app after updating permissions.

If your mic still isn't detected, check **System Settings → Sound → Input** to confirm it appears and shows input levels.

For Screen Time or parental control restrictions, check **System Settings → Screen Time → Content & Privacy → Apps**.

## Windows settings

Go to **Settings → Privacy & security → Microphone** and turn on access. Make sure "Let desktop apps access your microphone" is also enabled. Restart the app after updating permissions.

If your mic isn't detected, check **Settings → System → Sound → Input**. If it's not listed, verify it's enabled in **Device Manager → Audio inputs and outputs**.

For parental controls or workplace restrictions, review your device management settings or contact your administrator.
