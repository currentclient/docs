## What is status in CurrentClient?

CurrentClient lets you set your status to show your availability to your team and control how calls are handled. Your status can be set to **Online** or **Away**, helping you manage your work-life balance and team communication.

There are 3 different statuses you can set:

- **Online**: You're available and calls will ring through
- **Away**: You're not available and calls go to voicemail
- **On a call**: You're currently on a call

## Why use status?

There are three key benefits to using the status feature:

### 1. Control incoming calls

When you're set to **Away** and using our VoIP phone plan calls won't ring through to you. If you are using the call forwarding feature, calls will still ring like normal. They'll go straight to voicemail instead. Perfect for:

- Taking a vacation without interruptions
- Stepping away from the office for meetings
- Focus time when you need zero distractions
- After-hours peace of mind

### 2. Keep your team informed

Your status is visible to your entire team in the app. They'll instantly know:

- If you're available for calls
- When you're taking a break
- If they should expect a quick response
- When to reach out to someone else for urgent matters

### 3. Active call status

When you're on a call, your status automatically updates to show **"On a call"**. This lets your team know you're busy without you having to manually update anything.
