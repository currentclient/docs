## Quick fixes to try first

If your CurrentClient app isn't ringing when calls come in, there are a few things we can try for a quick fix! If these don't work, then please reach out to us!

### 1. Restart the app completely

Sometimes the app just needs a quick refresh:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="iOS" icon="apple">
    1. Swipe up from the bottom of your screen (or double-click home button)
    
    2. Find the CurrentClient app in your open apps
    
    3. Swipe it up to fully close it
    
    4. Reopen CurrentClient from your home screen
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Android" icon="android">

1. Open your recent apps (swipe up and hold or use the square button)

2. Find CurrentClient in the list

3. Swipe it away to close completely

4. Reopen the app

</Tab>

  <Tab title="Desktop" icon="desktop">

1. Fully quit the CurrentClient app (not just close the window)

2. On Mac: Cmd+Q or right-click dock icon â†’ Quit

3. On Windows: Close from system tray or Task Manager

4. Restart the application

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Check your status

Your status controls whether calls ring through:

- **Make sure you're set to "Online"** - If you're "Away", calls go straight to voicemail
- Check your status in the app (look for the status indicator)
- [Learn more about status settings](/guides/faq/what-is-my-status)

### 3. Verify call flow settings

Your call flow configuration determines how calls are routed:

- Go to your [dial plan settings](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/dial-plan)
- Ensure ringing is enabled for your user
- Check that you're included in the ring group
- [See the call flow guide for details](/guides/concepts/calling/call-flow)

## Additional troubleshooting steps

If the quick fixes didn't work, try these:

### Check device settings

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Do Not Disturb mode">
  Make sure your device isn't in Do Not Disturb or Focus mode:
  
- Check for the moon icon (iOS) or Do Not Disturb icon (Android)
  
- Disable any Focus modes that might block currentclient

- Add CurrentClient to allowed apps if you need to keep DND on

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internet connection">
    CurrentClient needs a stable internet connection:
    
    - Test your WiFi or cellular data
    
    - Try switching between WiFi and cellular
    
    - Check if other apps are working properly

  </Accordion>
