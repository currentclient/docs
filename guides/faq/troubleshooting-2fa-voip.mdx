title: Where are my 2FA codes?

## Are you trying to use CurrentClient for 2FA?

We get it, and we're really glad you're trying to streamline your team's authentication process! Using your CurrentClient number for two-factor authentication seems like a natural fit, and for many services, it works perfectly.

## The reality of 2FA with VoIP

Here's what we've learned: some companies will send 2FA codes to us, and some won't. It really depends on the service you're trying to authenticate with.

### What typically doesn't work

If the company is a bank or financial institution, it likely won't work. These organizations often have strict policies against sending authentication codes to VoIP numbers for security reasons.

Other services are generally more flexible with VoIP numbers

## Why companies block VoIP numbers

You're probably wondering why some companies won't send codes to VoIP numbers. It comes down to security concerns:

- VoIP numbers can be easier to obtain in bulk
- They're sometimes associated with higher fraud rates
- Financial institutions prefer numbers tied directly to major carriers
- Some security frameworks specifically prohibit VoIP for sensitive authentication

While we understand their caution, we know it can be frustrating when you're just trying to use your legitimate business phone system.

## Recommended (and more secure) option for your team

No worries though - there are solid alternatives that'll keep your team secure:

### Use an MFA app

This is often the best solution for teams. Consider setting up:

- **Google Authenticator** or **Microsoft Authenticator** for time-based codes
- **Authy** for multi-device sync capabilities
- **1Password** or **Bitwarden** if you're already using these password managers

These apps generate codes locally on your device, so there's no dependency on SMS delivery at all. Plus, they're actually more secure than SMS-based 2FA!
