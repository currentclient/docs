## How does conversation linking work?

CurrentClient can automatically sync your conversation history to your CRM, keeping everything organized in one place.

When someone calls or texts you, we automatically check for a matching contact record and connect the conversation. If we don't find a match, that's okay! You can still communicate normally. We just won't sync to the CRM until you link a contact.

## How can I attach a conversation to a client?

When you are on the desktop you can easily update the contact associated with a conversation. Lets check it out.

Go click into any conversation in your inbox.

#### If a contact _is_ attached

When this conversation is attached to a client it will look like this

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/explainers/web-conversation-detail-1v1.png"
    alt=""
    className="rounded-xl"
  />
</Frame>

You can see that the contact overview is listed on the right side of the screen.

If this connection is wrong or needs to be updated, you can unlink the contact from the conversation by clicking the "Unlink" button.

Now the conversation is not attached to any client, and we can attach a new one.

#### If a contact _is not_ attached

When this conversation is not attached to a client it will look like this

<Frame>
  <img

  />
</Frame>

(1) Shows the number you are messaging

(2) Shows contacts in your account already that have a matching phone number

(3) Gives you an option to create a new contact

From here, you can choose to attach to an existing contact or create a new one. That will link the conversation to the client and from this point on, any messages in this conversation will be synced to your CRM.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do you retroactively connect conversations to clients?">
    Not currently. We don't look back in time to connect past conversations to

    considering for the future!

  No, syncing is optional! You can turn off CRM conversation sync in your CRM
