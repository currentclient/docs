## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My app is not ringing when calls come in">
    Check that your call flow settings have ringing enabled for your user. Also
    verify: - Your status is set to "Online" - Notifications are enabled on your
    device - You're logged into the app For more troubleshooting, check our [FAQ
    page](/guides/faq/my-app-is-not-ringing).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="My voicemail recording doesn't sound great">
  For better audio quality, we recommend: 1. Record your greeting outside the
  browser using a good microphone 2. Save it as an MP3 or WAV file 3. Upload the
  file to CurrentClient This typically provides much clearer audio than
  recording directly in the browser.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have different call flows for different times?">
  Currently, you have one call flow configuration. For after-hours handling,
  team members can set their status to "Away" to send calls to voicemail.
  Time-based routing is on our roadmap!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long can my greeting be?">
  Greetings can be up to 60 seconds, but we recommend keeping them under 15
  seconds. Callers appreciate getting to their destination quickly.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I skip the greeting for certain callers?">
    Not currently, but VIP caller handling is a feature we're considering. The
    greeting plays for all incoming calls if enabled.
