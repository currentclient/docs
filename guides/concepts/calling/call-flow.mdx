Getting your calls to the right place at the right time is crucial for your business. Call flow lets you configure how CurrentClient handles every incoming call.

## What is call flow?

Call flow is your phone system's playbook - it tells CurrentClient exactly how to handle incoming calls to your business number. Think of it as your virtual receptionist that never takes a break.

## Available call flow options

### Initial greeting

Play a professional message when callers first connect. Perfect for:

- Welcoming callers to your business
- Sharing important disclaimers or compliance messages
- Setting expectations about wait times
- Providing quick information before connecting

### Auto-record calls

Automatically record all incoming calls for:

- Quality assurance and training
- Compliance requirements
- Reference for important conversations
- Protection in disputes

### Team ring settings

Control how calls ring to you and your team:

- **Ring all:** Everyone's phone rings simultaneously
- **Sequential:** Rings one person, then the next if no answer

### No-answer handling

Decide what happens when calls aren't answered:

- **Send to voicemail:** Callers can leave a message
- **Forward to another number:** Redirect to cell phone or backup line

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My app is not ringing when calls come in">
    Check that your call flow settings have ringing enabled for your user. Also
    verify: - Your status is set to "Online" - Notifications are enabled on your
    device - You're logged into the app For more troubleshooting, check our [FAQ
    page](/guides/faq/my-app-is-not-ringing).
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="My voicemail recording doesn't sound great">
  For better audio quality, we recommend: 1. Record your greeting outside the
  browser using a good microphone 2. Save it as an MP3 or WAV file 3. Upload the
  file to CurrentClient This typically provides much clearer audio than
  recording directly in the browser.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have different call flows for different times?">
  Currently, you have one call flow configuration. For after-hours handling,
  team members can set their status to "Away" to send calls to voicemail.
  Time-based routing is on our roadmap!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long can my greeting be?">
  Greetings can be up to 60 seconds, but we recommend keeping them under 15
  seconds. Callers appreciate getting to their destination quickly.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I skip the greeting for certain callers?">
    Not currently, but VIP caller handling is a feature we're considering. The
    greeting plays for all incoming calls if enabled.
