## What is call forwarding?

Call forwarding lets you have one phone number for both calling and texting, while still using your cell phone plan for actual calls. You'll use the CurrentClient app for all texting, while calls route through your personal phone.

## What happens when calls come in?

When someone calls your CurrentClient number, we automatically forward it to your cell phone. You answer like any regular call. If you don't answer, the call goes to your personal voicemail.

<Tip>
  Since calls go to your personal voicemail when unanswered, make sure your
  voicemail greeting sounds professional!

## How do I text with this setup?

Texting is very simple, you just use the CurrentClient app like you normally would. Texting will be sent from your CurrentClient business number to your client.

## How do I set this up?

To set up call forwarding, you need to add your cell phone number as the forwarding number in the dial plan settings.

You can change this number whenever you need, but the key is to give us a number you want us to forward calls to.

1. Go to your dial plan settings in the app
2. Enter your cell phone number as the forwarding number
3. Save your settings
