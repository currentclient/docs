## Understanding call recording regulations

Before recording calls, it's important to understand the legal requirements in your state. The United States has two types of consent laws:

- **One-party consent states:** Only one person on the call needs to know it's being recorded (that can be you)
- **Two-party consent states:** Everyone on the call must be informed and consent to recording

### Check your state's requirements

Not sure about your state's laws? Here is a helpful resource:

- [Justia's Recording Phone Calls Laws by State](https://www.justia.com/50-state-surveys/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations/)

<Tip>
  Regardless of your state's requirements, we recommend disclosing that you're
  recording calls as a professional courtesy. A simple "This call may be
  recorded for quality purposes" at the beginning builds trust with clients.

## Can I download recordings?

Yes, you can download any call recording directly from the call record. Just look for the download button next to the recording - it's that simple.

## Can I delete recordings?

Absolutely. You have full control over your recordings. Delete any recording directly from the call record interface when you no longer need it. This helps you manage storage and maintain only the recordings that matter.

## Best practices

- **Inform callers:** Always let people know when you're recording, even in one-party consent states
- **Secure storage:** Download and backup important recordings for your records
- **Team training:** Make sure your team knows the recording policies and legal requirements
