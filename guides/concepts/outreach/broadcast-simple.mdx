## What is a broadcast?

A broadcast is a one-to-many messaging tool that maintains the personal touch of a direct message. When you send a broadcast:

- Each recipient gets their own individual message
- They can't see other recipients
- It appears in their inbox like any other conversation with you
- They can reply directly to you

Think of it as a way to have the same conversation with many people at once, without losing the personal connection.

## Common use cases

Broadcasts are perfect for:

- **Holiday greetings**: Wish clients happy holidays
- **Important deadlines**: Remind clients about tax deadlines or filing dates
- **AEP for Medicare**: Notify eligible clients about Annual Enrollment Period
- **New workflows**: Introduce process changes that affect multiple clients
- **Client appreciation events**: Invite people to events and ask them to RSVP

## Best practices

- **Keep it short**: Respect your recipients' time with concise messages
- **Write personally**: Write as if you're sending to one person, not a group
- **Don't spam**: Only send broadcasts when you'd be confident sending the message to each person individually and with their consent
- **Make it relevant**: Ensure the message is actually relevant to everyone on your list
- **Include a clear call-to-action**: Make it obvious what you want recipients to do next
