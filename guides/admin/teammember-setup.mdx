<Step title="Setup your voicemail">

  settings:

    Configure voicemail →
  </a>  
  You'll see your phone number listed (it may have your name on it or just show
  the number that was ported in). Click "Configure" and scroll down to find the
  option to record or upload your voicemail greeting.
</Step>

  <Step title="Turn on notifications">
    Want to stay in the loop? You can configure notifications to make sure you never miss an important message or call:

    <a href="https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/notifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Configure notifications →
    </a>

    Don't forget - the mobile app has its own notification settings too. Check the "Settings" menu in the app to customize those.
