When setting up CurrentClient, it's helpful to understand how your account is structured. Let's walk through how it all fits together.

## Account Setup

When you sign up with CurrentClient, an **organization** is created for you along with a default **workspace**. You can add additional workspaces if you need them, but it's important to understand what a workspace is first.

An organization is a grouping of:

- Workspaces

A workspace is a grouping of:

- Phone numbers (inboxes)
- Team members
- Contact list (CRM sync)

## How should I setup my account?

This is going to depend largely on your firm size and the boundaries around which team members work together.

If you're around 1-20 people, you're probably good to run in a single workspace. If you have some natural boundaries around your teams, then you may consider doing multiple workspaces.

Here's a quick video that dives into this idea:

## Our Recommendation

When in doubt, start with a single workspace. It gives you the most flexibility and is easier to manage - you can always add more workspaces later as your needs evolve!
