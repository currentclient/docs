## Adding a new workspace

Here's how to add a workspace to your organization:

### Step 1: Access organization management

Navigate to your profile by clicking on your profile picture in the bottom left corner, then click the **Manage Organization** button.

  />
</Frame>

### Step 2: Navigate to workspaces

Once you're in the organization settings, click on the **Workspaces** tab. You'll see a list of your current workspaces along with a button to add new ones.

    className="rounded-xl"
  />
</Frame>

### Step 3: Create the workspace

Click the **Add New Workspace** button and fill in the required information:

- **Workspace name**: Choose something descriptive like "Sales Team" or "Chicago Office"
- **Primary contact email**: The email address for the workspace administrator

Once you create the workspace, the designated admin will receive an email invitation to set up their account and complete the workspace configuration.

### Step 4: Configure the workspace

After the workspace is created, you can click into it from your workspace list to:

- Review usage and billing
- Setup archiving rules
- Review team members

<Tip>
  As an organization admin, you have the ability to **impersonate** users in any
  workspace. This powerful feature lets you log in as them to help with
  configuration, troubleshooting, or training. Use this responsibly and only
  when necessary.
</Tip>

## Managing multiple workspaces

Once you have multiple workspaces, here are some helpful things to know:

- **Billing**: Workspaces can be billed to the main organization account if you mark them as managed billing, if not, they will have to create a separate subscription when signing up.
- **Phone numbers**: Each workspace can have its own phone numbers that are managed independently.
- **Users**: Team members can belong to only one workspace right now.
- **Settings**: Each workspace maintains its own settings for features like call recording, voicemail, and business hours
