## What is the Text Us widget?

The Text Us widget is an embeddable button you can add to your website that lets visitors start a text conversation with you. When someone clicks it, they're prompted to send a text message that goes straight to your inbox. It's a frictionless way to get people off your website and into a real conversation.

## Customization

You can tailor the widget to fit your brand and compliance needs:

- **Widget color** - Match the button to your brand colors
- **Custom response message** - Set the message visitors see after they reach out
- **Disclosures** - Add any compliance disclosures your business requires
- **TCPA opt-in language** - Built-in consent language to cover opt-in requirements

## Setting it up

Grab the widget code snippet from your [workspace settings](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/widget), then add it to your website. Here's how to do it on a couple of popular platforms:

      <Step title="Save your changes">
        Click **Update File**.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

      Theme updates can overwrite your changes. If your theme updates frequently, the WPCode plugin method is a safer option.
