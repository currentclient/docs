## What is a workspace?

A workspace is a separate environment within your CurrentClient organization that helps you organize teams, departments, or different business units. Each workspace has its own phone numbers, conversations, and settings - perfect for keeping things organized while maintaining centralized billing and administration.

<Note>
  You need to be an admin in your CurrentClient account to add workspaces. If
  you don't see these options, reach out to your organization admin for help.

## What goes into a workspace?

There are 3 main things that make up a workspace:

- **Phone numbers** - You can have multiple numbers in a workspace, each with its own inbox
- **Team members** - You can have multiple team members in a workspace who can all collaborate
- **Contacts** - You can sync a CRM and provide a list of contacts in a workspace

## Who should be in a workspace?

Here's when it makes sense for people to share a workspace:

- **Shared phone access** - If you need to easily share access to a phone number, you should be in the same workspace
- **Call routing** - If you need to easily transfer calls and route them to the right person, same workspace works best (you can still do it across workspaces, just takes a couple more clicks)
- **Shared contacts** - If you're okay sharing a contact list, you're a good fit for the same workspace

## When should you use separate workspaces?

Sometimes it's better to keep things separate:

- **Different contact lists** - If you don't share contacts, separate workspaces make sense
- **Independent operations** - If you don't need to ever share, see, or help out in each other's inbox, you don't need to share a workspace
- **No call routing needed** - If you don't need to route calls between team members, separate workspaces can work well
