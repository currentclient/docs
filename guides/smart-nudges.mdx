## What are Smart Nudges?

Smart Nudges automatically generates AI-powered follow-up text message suggestions based on your CRM tasks. Instead of manually reviewing your task list and drafting messages, Smart Nudges surfaces the most important follow-ups and gives you ready-to-send suggestions right in your dashboard.

It's like having an assistant that reads through your task list, figures out who needs a follow-up, and drafts the message for you.

## How it works

Smart Nudges follows a five-step process to turn your CRM tasks into actionable follow-up suggestions:

1. **Pull tasks from your CRM** - Smart Nudges connects to your CRM (currently Wealthbox) and pulls in your open tasks
2. **Classify tasks with AI** - Each task is analyzed to determine if it's client-facing or internal. Tasks with no linked contact are filtered out since there's no one to nudge
3. **Score and rank by urgency** - Tasks are scored based on factors like whether they're past due, due soon, priority level, and any notes attached to them
4. **Match to contacts** - Your CRM contacts are matched to their corresponding CurrentClient contacts so the nudge can be delivered to the right person
5. **Deliver as suggested nudges** - The highest-priority follow-ups appear as suggested nudges in your dashboard, complete with a draft message you can review, edit, and send
