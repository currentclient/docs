Segments are especially useful when you need to work with a specific group of contacts. Instead of manually filtering every time, you can save those filters as a segment and access them instantly.

## What is a segment?

A segment is a saved list of filters. Think of it as a smart group that automatically includes contacts who match your criteria.

For example, if you create a segment with the rule "Tag must contain Active Client," the segment will always show you contacts with that tag - no manual sorting needed.

## How segments work

When you view a segment, the system only displays contacts that match all of your filter rules.

</Frame>

You can view any segment by clicking the filter option (spot 2 in the image above), then selecting the segment you want to see.

## Creating a segment

Click the "Add segment" button to get started.

Then build your filter rules based on what you need.

### Understanding the AND logic

**Important:** When you create multiple rules, all of them must be true for a contact to match. Think of each rule with an "AND" between them.

For example, if you have these 3 rules:

- Tag contains Contact Type: Client
- Tag does not contain Flag: Do Not Text
- Last contacted more than 45 days ago

The contact must match all three:
The contact must have a tag containing "Contact Type: Client" **AND** not have "Flag: Do Not Text" **AND** have been last contacted more than 45 days ago.

This gives you precise control over exactly which contacts appear in your segment.
