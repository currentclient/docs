Your contacts are the heart of your communication in CurrentClient. Whether you're syncing from your CRM or uploading a CSV, you'll have everything you need to stay organized and connected with your clients.

## Adding contacts

There are two ways to get contacts into CurrentClient:

- **Upload a CSV file** - Import contacts in bulk from a spreadsheet
- **Sync your CRM** - We refresh daily to keep your contacts up to date

Once your contacts are in, you'll see them on the main contacts page where you can search, filter, and take action.

## Viewing and filtering contacts

You can find the contacts page in the left side navigation. From there, you can filter and search for specific contacts to find exactly who you're looking for.

## Creating a contact

If you're not synced with a CRM, this will create a contact in CurrentClient. Simple.

If you're synced with a CRM, creating a contact here will also create it in your CRM. Once you fill out the form and hit create, it will be created in your CRM, then immediately synced to your CurrentClient account.

### Don't want to sync it to your CRM?

Sometimes you need a contact that doesn't belong in your CRM - like support numbers for Fidelity or Schwab. Look at option (1) in the image above, and you'll see the "CurrentClient only" button. Click that, and the contact will only live in CurrentClient without syncing to your CRM.

## Deleting a contact

**If you're synced with a CRM:** We recommend you delete the contact in your CRM, and it will be removed from CurrentClient on the next sync. If contacts are coming in that you dont want, then review the sync connection and edit to filter out those contact types.
Edit your [crm sync](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/crm-sync)

**If you're not synced:** Select the contact on the [contacts page](https://app.currentclient.com/app/contacts/all), click the "Bulk actions" button, and choose "Archive contact."

## Pro tip: Customize your tags

Click the "Tags" button to edit tag colors and pin important tags as favorites. This makes it easier to organize and find the contacts that matter most to you.
