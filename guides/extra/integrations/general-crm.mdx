</Info>

- **One-way Sync:** Data flows from CRM to CurrentClient only
- **Two-way Sync:** Data syncs in both directions automatically  
- **Scheduled Sync:** Updates occur at regular intervals
- **Real-time Sync:** Changes sync immediately when made

## Field Mapping Strategy

    Map essential fields like name, phone, email, and company
  </Step>
  <Step title="Custom Field Alignment">
    Align custom fields between both systems
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tag Mapping">
    Decide how CRM categories translate to CurrentClient tags
  </Step>
  <Step title="Date Field Handling">
    Configure how dates and timestamps are handled
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common Sync Issues">
  **Duplicate Records:**
  - Set up duplicate detection rules in both systems
  - Use unique identifiers for matching records
  - Regularly clean up duplicates before syncing

  **Field Mismatches:**
  - Ensure data types match between systems
  - Check for character limits on text fields
  - Verify date formats are compatible

  **Permission Errors:**
  - Confirm API access is enabled in your CRM
  - Check that integration user has appropriate permissions
  - Verify CurrentClient has necessary access tokens
</Accordion>

## Best Practices

### Data Hygiene
- Clean up existing data before integration
- Establish consistent data entry standards
- Regular audits to maintain data quality
- Set up validation rules where possible

### Workflow Optimization
- Define which system is the "source of truth" for each data type
- Establish clear processes for data conflicts
- Train team members on integration workflows
- Monitor integration performance regularly

<Warning>
  **Integration Limits:** Some CRM integrations have API call limits or data volume restrictions. Review these limitations before setting up high-frequency sync schedules.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Success Tip:** Start with a basic integration using core fields, then gradually add complexity as you become comfortable with the sync process.
