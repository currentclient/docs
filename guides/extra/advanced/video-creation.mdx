## Technical Best Practices

<Accordion title="Lighting and Setup">
  **Professional Lighting Tips:**
  - Face a window for natural light (avoid backlighting)
  - Use soft, diffused lighting to avoid harsh shadows
  - Position lights at eye level to avoid unflattering angles
  - Test your setup before recording important videos
  - Consider time of day for consistent natural lighting
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audio Quality">
  **Clear Audio Guidelines:**
  - Record in a quiet space with minimal background noise
  - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
  - Use an external microphone when possible
  - Test audio levels before recording
  - Consider acoustic treatment for echo reduction
</Accordion>

## Recording and Editing

### Recording Tips
- **Practice First:** Run through your content before recording
- **Multiple Takes:** Don't be afraid to record multiple versions
- **Natural Delivery:** Speak conversationally, not like reading a script
- **Eye Contact:** Look directly at the camera lens, not the screen
- **Steady Camera:** Use a tripod or stable surface to avoid shaky footage

### Basic Editing
- **Trim Excess:** Remove dead air at beginning and end
- **Cut Mistakes:** Edit out verbal stumbles and long pauses
- **Add Captions:** Include subtitles for accessibility
- **Brand Elements:** Add your logo or contact information
- **Optimize Length:** Keep videos concise - typically 2-5 minutes

<Warning>
  **File Size Considerations:** Large video files can be difficult to send via email. Consider using video hosting platforms or compression tools for easier sharing.
</Warning>

## Measuring Video Success

Track these key metrics:
- **View Rate:** Percentage of recipients who watched the video
- **Completion Rate:** How many viewers watched to the end
- **Response Rate:** Responses or actions taken after viewing
- **Engagement Time:** Average time spent watching
- **Conversion Rate:** Business outcomes generated from videos

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Use your phone's voice-to-text feature when adding call notes for faster documentation while maintaining accuracy. Start with simple talking-head videos and gradually add more sophisticated elements as you become comfortable with video creation.
