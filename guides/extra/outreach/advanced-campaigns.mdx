## Persistence Without Pestering

### Professional Persistence Guidelines

- **Value First:** Each touchpoint should provide value
- **Vary Approaches:** Change message style and format
- **Respect Responses:** Honor opt-outs immediately  
- **Professional Tone:** Maintain courtesy throughout
- **Track Interactions:** Note all touchpoints and responses

### When to Stop

Stop outreach when contacts:
- Explicitly request to be removed
- Show no engagement after 5-7 touchpoints
- Mark messages as spam
- Block or unsubscribe from communications

<Warning>
  **Compliance Alert:** Always respect unsubscribe requests and maintain compliant outreach practices. Persistent doesn't mean ignoring opt-out requests.
