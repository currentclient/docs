## Delivery Timing

<Info>
  **Optimal Send Times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM typically see the highest engagement rates, but test with your specific audience.
</Info>

### Time Zone Considerations
- Send based on recipient's local time zone
- Use CurrentClient's scheduling to optimize delivery
- Consider business hours for B2B communications
- Test different times to find your audience's preferences

### Avoid These Times
- Very early morning or late evening
- Weekends (unless appropriate for your audience)
- Major holidays and vacation periods
- Industry-specific busy periods

<Warning>
  **Compliance Note:** Always ensure you have proper consent before sending broadcast messages. Follow TCPA guidelines and include opt-out options.
</Warning>

## Measuring Success

Track these key metrics:
- **Delivery Rate** - Messages successfully delivered
- **Open Rate** - Recipients who viewed the message  
- **Response Rate** - Recipients who replied
- **Conversion Rate** - Recipients who took desired action
- **Opt-out Rate** - Recipients who unsubscribed

<Tip>
  **Success Metric:** Focus on meaningful engagement rather than just delivery numbers. A smaller, more engaged audience often produces better results than a large, unengaged list.
