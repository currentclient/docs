When you're using business texting, TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act) regulations require you to send an initial disclosure message to anyone you're texting for the first time. We've built this right into CurrentClient, so you're covered automatically.

## What is TCPA?

TCPA is a federal law designed to protect consumers from unwanted communications and spam. It sets rules for how businesses can text and call people, and it's pretty serious stuff - violations can result in significant fines.

The main goal? Fight spam and ensure people only receive messages they've consented to.

## What you need to include

Your initial disclosure message needs three key elements:

1. **Who you are** - Your business name
2. **Why you're contacting them** - The reason for your message
3. **How to opt out** - Clear instructions to text STOP to unsubscribe

<Info>
  CurrentClient sends this disclosure message automatically the first time you
  text someone. You don't have to remember or do anything special - we handle it
  for you.

## How CurrentClient handles compliance

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

- **Automatic sending**: Whenever you text someone for the first time, we automatically send your compliance message before your actual message goes through
- **One-time only**: After the initial disclosure is sent, we won't send it again to that number
- **Always compliant**: The message format follows TCPA requirements, so you can focus on your conversation

This means you can text with confidence, knowing you're staying on the right side of the law.

## Customize your compliance message

While we provide a default message that meets legal requirements, we suggest customizing it to match your firm's tone and style.

To edit your compliance message:

1. Go to your [Inbox Settings](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/phone-numbers)
2. Find the "Compliance Message" section
3. Edit the message to reflect your business name and style
4. Make sure you keep the three required elements (who you are, why you're contacting them, and how to opt out)

<Warning>
  Always include clear opt-out instructions in your compliance message. The
  standard "Reply STOP to unsubscribe" wording works well and is widely
  understood.
</Warning>

## Best practices

Here are some tips for crafting an effective compliance message:

- **Keep it brief**: People are more likely to read shorter messages
- **Be clear**: Use plain language that anyone can understand
- **Stay professional**: This is often someone's first impression of your business
- **Test it yourself**: Send a test message to your own phone to see how it reads

## What happens after the disclosure

Once someone receives your initial disclosure message:

- They can reply STOP at any time to opt out (learn more in [Managing unsubscribes](/guides/inbox/unsubscribe))
- All future messages you send will go through normally without the disclosure
- The relationship is established and compliant
