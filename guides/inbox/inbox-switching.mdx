If you have multiple phone numbers set up in your workspace, you'll want to switch between them to view different conversations. Each number has its own inbox, so switching lets you manage communications from different lines separately.

This is especially useful if you're managing separate business lines, different departments, or multiple locations - you can keep each inbox organized and respond from the right number.

## Switching on mobile

On the mobile app, you'll find the inbox selector in the side menu. Simply open the menu from the left side of your screen, and you'll see your list of available inboxes. Tap the one you want to switch to.

Here's a quick walkthrough showing how to toggle between your inboxes:

## Switching on web

When you're using the web app, switching between inboxes is simple. Just click on the inbox selector in the top left corner of your screen - it's labeled with the current phone number or inbox name you're viewing.

In the image above, you can see the inbox selector in the top left area (callout 1). Click there to see all your available inboxes and select the one you want to view.

## When to use multiple numbers

You'll find inbox switching helpful when you:

- **Manage main line and direct numbers**: Keep personal and business communications separate
- **Handle different departments**: Switch between sales, support, or admin lines
- **Work across locations**: If you have numbers for different offices
- **Monitor team inboxes**: Check on different numbers your team manages

The inbox you're viewing persists until you switch it, so you won't need to constantly toggle back and forth during your workday.
