Group chats are great for keeping everyone in the loop on a single conversation thread. Everyone receives the messages together and can see each other's responses - perfect for coordinating with couples, families, or small teams.

## How to create a group chat

Creating a group message is straightforward:

1. **Start a new conversation** in your inbox
2. **Add multiple people** to the recipient field
3. **Send your message** - everyone will receive it together

That's it! From that point on, all participants will see each other's messages in the same thread.

## When to use group messages

Group messages work well for:

- **Couples or families**: Keep both spouses in the conversation
- **Small team coordination**: Quick updates with 2-3 people
- **Event planning**: Coordinate with multiple people at once
- **Joint client accounts**: When you work with partners or co-clients

## Group messages vs. broadcasts

It's important to understand the difference:

**Group messages:**
- Everyone sees each other's responses
- One shared conversation thread
- Great for collaboration and discussion

**Broadcasts:**
- Each person gets an individual message
- Recipients don't see each other
- Great for announcements and one-way communication

Choose group messages when you want conversation and collaboration. Choose broadcasts when you want to send personalized messages to many people.
