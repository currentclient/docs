When someone wants to stop receiving messages from you, they have a simple way to opt out. Understanding how unsubscribes work helps you stay compliant and respect your clients' preferences.

## How unsubscribe works

If someone texts specific opt-out keywords, CurrentClient automatically marks them as unsubscribed and stops sending them messages:

**Standard opt-out keywords:**

- STOP
- QUIT
- UNSUBSCRIBE
- CANCEL
- END

When someone sends any of these words, they'll be immediately unsubscribed and you won't be able to send them messages until they opt back in.

## Where to view unsubscribers

You can see everyone who's unsubscribed in your [Unsubscribers list](https://app.currentclient.com/app/settings/unsubscribers). This list shows:

- When they unsubscribed
- Which number they unsubscribed from
- Their name if it matches a contact

This helps you keep track of opt-outs across your workspace and stay compliant with messaging regulations.

## How people re-subscribe

If someone wants to start receiving messages again, they need to text **START** to your number. This will automatically remove them from the unsubscribe list and allow you to message them again.

You cannot re-subscribe someone on their behalf - they must opt back in themselves by texting START.

## Manually unsubscribe someone

Sometimes you might need to unsubscribe someone manually (for example, if they asked you to stop messaging them through another channel).

To manually unsubscribe someone:

1. Open the conversation with the contact
2. Click the actions menu on the top right
3. Select "Unsubscribe"

They'll be added to your unsubscribers list and won't receive any more messages until they text START.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I try to message someone who's unsubscribed?">
    The system will prevent the message from sending and let you know that the contact is unsubscribed. You'll need to wait for them to opt back in by texting START.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do unsubscribes apply to all my numbers or just one?">
  Unsubscribes are number-specific. If someone unsubscribes from one of your
  numbers, they can still receive messages from your other numbers (unless they
  unsubscribe from those too).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are automated messages blocked too?">
  Yes, all messages are blocked for unsubscribed contacts - including
  broadcasts, automated workflows, and scheduled messages. This ensures full
  compliance with their opt-out request.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete someone from the unsubscribers list?">
    No, you can't manually remove someone from the list. They must opt back in themselves by texting START. This protects both you and your contacts by ensuring compliance with messaging regulations.
