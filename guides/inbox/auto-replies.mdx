## What are auto-replies?

Auto-replies are a helpful way to respond to people when they call or text you. They let contacts know you've received their message and when to expect a response.

## When to use auto-replies

### Outside business hours

This is the most common use case for auto-replies. When someone reaches out after hours, they'll get an automatic response letting them know you'll get back to them during business hours.

**How it works:**
1. Set your business hours in your phone number settings
2. When someone texts you outside those hours, they get an auto-reply
3. When someone calls you outside those hours, you can use an auto-reply or voicemail greeting (voicemail is usually sufficient for calls)

### Out of office

Going on vacation or taking time off? Set up an out of office auto-reply to let people know when you'll be back.

### During business hours

You can also enable auto-replies during business hours if you want to acknowledge receipt of all messages. This is less common, but can be useful if you want to set response time expectations.

## Writing warm and professional messages

Keep your auto-replies friendly and helpful. Here are some examples:

### Outside business hours

✅ **Good:**
> "Thanks for reaching out! We've received your message and will get back to you during business hours (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm CST)."

✅ **Good:**
> "We appreciate you contacting us! Our office hours are Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm. We'll respond to your message first thing tomorrow morning."

❌ **Too formal:**
> "Your inquiry has been received and will be processed during normal operating hours."

### Out of office

✅ **Good:**
> "Thanks for your message! I'm out of the office until Monday, June 10th. I'll respond when I return. For urgent matters, please contact Sarah at 555-0123."

✅ **Good:**
> "I'm currently away and will have limited access to messages. I'll be back in the office on June 10th and will get back to you then. Thanks for your patience!"

### During business hours (optional)

✅ **Good:**
> "Thanks for reaching out! We've received your message and typically respond within 2 hours during business hours."
