While we don't have an official Make integration yet, you can connect CurrentClient to Make using direct API calls with an API key.

To get started, you'll need to request an API key from our team. We'll generate a secure key specifically for your Make integration.

Once you have your API key, you can view the complete API documentation for Make integration:
