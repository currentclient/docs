## Getting Started with Quivr Integration

Ready to connect CurrentClient with Quivr? We'll walk you through the setup process step by step. It's pretty straightforward!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to CRM Sync Settings">
    Start by heading to your CurrentClient CRM sync settings:

    This is where you'll manage all your CRM integrations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Quivr CRM">
    From the list of available CRMs, select **Quivr**.

    <Tip>
      Look at the URL when you're logged into Quivr. If you see something like:

      `https://my-firm-name.lightning.force.com/one/one.app`

      You should enter just: **my-firm-name**
    </Tip>

    This identifies your unique Quivr workspace.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect and Authenticate">
    Hit the **Connect** button. You'll be redirected to Quivr to authenticate and authorize the connection.
    
    Sign in with your Quivr credentials if prompted, and approve the integration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Success!">
    Great job! You're now connected to Quivr. 
    
    Now let's configure how CurrentClient syncs with your CRM.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure Your Sync Options

Once connected, you have several options to customize how CurrentClient works with Quivr:

### Daily Conversation Summary

**Add daily conversation summary to my CRM** - When enabled, every morning we'll write a summary of the previous day's conversations and add it to the Quivr activity record.

- By default, we include both calls and texts
- Don't want calls included? Toggle **"But only include texts, not phone calls"**
- These summaries help you keep a comprehensive record of all client interactions

### Real-time Call History

**Add call history in realtime** - When enabled, calls are added to Quivr immediately as they happen, rather than waiting for the daily summary.

This is perfect if you need:

- Instant visibility of client interactions
- Real-time reporting and tracking
- Immediate access to call data in your CRM

### Disable Sync

Don't want CurrentClient to write to Quivr at all? No problem!

Simply disable the **"Add daily conversation summary"** option and CurrentClient won't write any data to Quivr. You'll still maintain the connection for potential future use.

## What Happens Next?

After setup:

- Your selected data will begin syncing according to your preferences
- Daily summaries (if enabled) will appear each morning
- Real-time updates (if enabled) will flow immediately
- All your client communications will be organized in Quivr
