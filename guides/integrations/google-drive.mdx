## Backup your recordings to Google Drive

CurrentClient can automatically send all your call recordings to a Google Drive folder. It's the perfect way to keep a secure backup of all your important conversations.

## Why use Google Drive integration?

**Automatic backups**  
Every recording is automatically saved to your Google Drive folder - no manual work needed. You'll always have a backup copy safe in the cloud.

**Enable powerful automations**  
Since Google Drive triggers are available in Zapier and other automation platforms, you can build workflows that react to new recordings. Send them off for transcription, AI analysis, or any other processing you need!

**Team accessibility**  
Share the Google Drive folder with your team so everyone has access to call recordings when they need them.

**Compliance and archiving**  
Keep a permanent archive of all recordings for compliance requirements or future reference.
