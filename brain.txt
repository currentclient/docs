Also, I forgot to mention but message watcher has a $50 minimum on their website but I only needed email and texting which is $15 I was told they would waive the $50 minimum for me because I was using current client and they wanted more current client customers. Just thought that might be good Intel for you to have if you end up with somebody that doesn't need archiving of websites and social media and all the other things. I spoke with archive Intel briefly but their minimum is $100 a month.
