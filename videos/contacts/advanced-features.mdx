## Custom Field Best Practices

<Info>
  **Planning First:** Before creating custom fields, plan your data structure. Consider what reports you'll need and how the data will be used for segmentation.
</Info>

### Field Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names
- Be consistent across similar fields
- Avoid abbreviations that might be confusing
- Include units for numerical fields (Revenue_USD)

### Data Standardization

- Create dropdown lists for consistent values
- Use validation rules where possible
- Document field purposes for team members
- Regular audit field usage and cleanup unused fields

## Segment Automation

<Tip>
  **Dynamic Segments:** Set up segments that automatically update based on changing contact data. This ensures your targeting remains accurate without manual updates.
</Tip>

### Automated Workflows

- Welcome sequences for new segment members
- Follow-up campaigns based on segment criteria  
- Alerts when contacts move between segments
- Scheduled reports on segment performance

## Reporting and Analytics

Custom fields and segments enable powerful reporting:

- **Conversion Rates** by segment
- **Performance Metrics** by custom field values
- **Geographic Analysis** using location fields
- **Lifecycle Reports** tracking contact progression

<Warning>
  **Data Privacy:** Be mindful of privacy regulations when creating custom fields. Avoid collecting unnecessary personal data and ensure proper consent for sensitive information.
